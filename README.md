# MobiusStrip-Pringle
Python script generating a pringles chip

This code generates and plots a Möbius strip using Python's NumPy and Matplotlib libraries.

The code can be divided into two parts, each producing a different visualization of the Möbius strip.

## Part 1:
In this part, the Möbius strip is plotted as a surface with a twisted shape. The strip is defined by its radius, width, number of twists, and number of points.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

The necessary libraries are imported: numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, and mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.Axes3D.

Parameters for the Möbius strip are set:

radius represents the radius of the strip.
width represents the width of the strip.
num_twists represents the number of twists in the strip.
num_points represents the number of points on the strip.
Parameter values are generated:

theta is an array of evenly spaced values from 0 to 2π (a full circle).
w represents the width of the strip at each angle. It is calculated by multiplying width with the cosine of half the angle (to create the twist effect).
x, y, and z coordinates are generated using the parameter values:

x represents the x-coordinates of the points on the strip.
y represents the y-coordinates of the points on the strip.
z represents the z-coordinates of the points on the strip.
A 3D plot is created using matplotlib.pyplot.figure() and matplotlib.pyplot.subplot().

The Möbius strip is plotted by calling plot(x, y, z) on the plot object, specifying the color as blue and the line width as 2.

The plot limits and labels are set to adjust the visualization.

Finally, the plot is displayed using matplotlib.pyplot.show().

## Part 2:
In this part, the Möbius strip is plotted as a solid object. The surface is represented by connecting the points on the strip.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

The necessary libraries are imported: numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.Axes3D, and mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d.Poly3DCollection.

Parameters for the Möbius strip are set, similar to Part 1.

Parameter values are generated, similar to Part 1.

x, y, and z coordinates are generated using the parameter values, similar to Part 1.

A 3D plot is created, similar to Part 1.

A Poly3DCollection object is created by passing the vertices (x, y, z coordinates) as a list.

The Poly3DCollection object is added to the plot using add_collection3d() on the plot object.

The plot limits and labels are set, similar to Part 1.

Finally, the plot is displayed using matplotlib.pyplot.show().

Both parts produce a different visualization of the Möbius strip. You can choose which part to run based on the desired representation of the Möbius strip.

Make sure to have the necessary libraries installed (NumPy and Matplotlib) to run the code successfully.
